# Corey Wade

**25 years enterprise infrastructure x AI/ML PhD candidate**

Building tools at the intersection of network operations, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. CCIE #14124 | CISSP | SOFAM researcher.

**[netopshub.com](https://netopshub.com)** — AI-native network operations platform

## What I Build

**AI + Network Operations** — LLM agents that interact with network devices via MCP, RAG over vendor documentation, GNN-based topology analysis, time series anomaly detection for infrastructure metrics.

**AI + Cybersecurity** — Federated learning for cross-org threat detection, MITRE ATT&CK automation, SOC triage agents, zero trust behavioral analytics.

**Production ML Systems** — MLOps pipelines, model governance, edge inference, guardrails for infrastructure AI, custom fine-tuned LLMs.
